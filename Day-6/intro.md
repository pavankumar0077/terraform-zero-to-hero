- Let say there is a DEV TEAM called XYZ
- There requrirement is they want to set a EC2 instance with S3 bucket on the AWS env
- They have to do this task everything, So they created a JIRA ticket on the DEVOPS ENGINEERING TEAM Dashboard
- As a Devops we have picked this request
- So as a devops your task to create the reqest resources provides in the JIRA Ticket
- So devops carefully went to the request and find that these can can also be useful for the other teams as well commonly used task
- So that devops engineer created **MODULE** or it.
- As you wrote in the MODULAR Approach it can be resusable, Your are not solving the problem for XYZ team, but solving the problem for the future TEAMS as well.
- Along with MODULE file you also provide the README file with the instructions how to use it
- If something not getting by the README file then you will create main.tf file and write some instuctions to use it
